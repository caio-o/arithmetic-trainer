# Arithmetic trainer
  A simple command line program for practicing arithmetic, by solving randomply generated problems, constructed according to user's configurations. It is still incomplete, except for the problems of addition and subtraction. 
  I do this more for my learning of C and of Git, than for the utility of the program. I imagine that this would be better if written in shellscript, and so I shall eventually do it. 

## User configuration
* Amount of problems: the user either chooses to solve a certain number of expressions, or to solve as many as he can until he misses or (TODO) runs out of time (sudden death).
* Difficulty: expression size and complexity are determined by user-defined difficulty.
* The opperations used in the expressions are also user-defined.
* I am considering making version that takes information from userconfig.cgf file, making the program more tweekable.
